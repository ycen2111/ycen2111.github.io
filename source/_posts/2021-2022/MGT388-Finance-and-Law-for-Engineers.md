The strength of an authority(威权) will depend upon it having like facts to the case in hand and generally that it was decided in a higher court. 
The question of what amounts to ‘like facts’ is not always easy 
Two very able advocates(提倡者) trying to persuade the court that the strength of authority supports their case rather than the opposition
Have no standard terms and conditions!!!

Contract law regards with civil(民法) law instead of criminal(刑法) law
criminal law: face to social security, operate by state, paid to state and must show defendant(被告) is guilty.
civil law: brought individual who fells have suffered, paid to party who bringing action and claimant(索赔人) must show defendant is liable ‘on the balance of probabilities’(the probability whether defendant is guilty based on evidence from two parties)

contract law regards private not public law
public sector(公共部门) follows public functions is public law, but they purchas pens or paying construction regards private law.

Generally, only the parties to the contract can enforce it in court

Common law and equity are two methods for the judge. common law means sertainty but equity means court can deal the case with discretionary(自由裁量权)

contract is an agreement giving rise to obligations which are enforced or recognised by law.

Why enter into a contract?

### acceptance
an acceptance means absolute and unequivocal(明确的), and must be communicated (but not postal rule).
