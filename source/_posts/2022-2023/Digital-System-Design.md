# Clock time calculation
![001.png](001.png)
• Clock period (clock cycle time)
• Clock frequency (clock rate) = 1/Clock period
• Clock Cycle Time = 1/Clock rate
• CPU Time = CPU Clock Cycles * Clock Cycle Time
• Clock Cycles = Instruction Count * Cycles per Instruction (CPI)
note: if there have multiple IC and CPI, final clock cycles is their summ result
